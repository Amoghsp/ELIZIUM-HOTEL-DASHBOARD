Elizium Hotel Dashboard

Description

This project provides a deep dive into over 10,000 hotel bookings and guest records to optimize hospitality operations. Beyond just "total occupancy," this analysis explores the financial health of the business by examining how lead times, distribution channels, and seasonal trends impact RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room). The goal is to identify operational gaps and guest preferences that drive sustainable revenue growth and improve reporting efficiency.
